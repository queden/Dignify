# Dignify
We created a Homeless Management Information System called **Dignify**. Dignify offers three main services:
* Providing those in need with a centralized database of nearby shelters, food banks, and other vital services and crowd-sourcing reviews and data on when food is being served, beds are open, etc.
* Providing accurate data to service providers to quantify their results to use for applying to grant funding
* Obtaining accurate information on the homeless population to sell to cities, who are legally obligated to use HMIS's
We innovate where other HMIS's fail by providing complete privacy to those experiencing homeless. No personal data, including their name, is collected, and they are simply provided a unique ID. This allows them to take advantage of the resources provided to them without fear of their information leaked to the government, a fear that has prevented many of them from using other HMIS's.

Over 80% of the homeless population has access to a phone, which is why we built out an app solution. This repository contains the code for our Xamarin.Forms cross-platform app solution. Check out https://github.com/himaniyadav/dignify to see our website for those that do not have access to a smart phone. Thank you for checking us out!
